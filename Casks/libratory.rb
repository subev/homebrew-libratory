    <<~EOS
      Libratory keeps your library in Postgres, run through Docker. Install Docker Desktop
      or OrbStack and have it running before the first launch:

        brew install --cask orbstack        # lighter, Mac only
        brew install --cask docker-desktop  # or the original

      `brew uninstall --zap` removes the app, its Python runtime and the data folder holding
      your finished audiobooks, but not the Docker volume with the library or the downloaded
      models. https://github.com/subev/libratory/blob/main/docs/uninstall.md lists those.
